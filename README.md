## Introduction

Given how fast I completed my first 2D game, and the formal training I have in Computer Graphics, I believe it is time 
to build a 3D game.



# Tactical Warfare


Creating a 3D army game with an omnipresent third-person view, similar to "End War," using HTML5 Canvas and potentially WebGL for rendering 3D graphics, is a complex project. It involves several components such as game design, 3D modeling, game physics, AI for unit control, and multiplayer networking if you intend to include that feature. Here's a high-level plan to get started on such a project, focusing on the foundational steps:

# Step 1: Game Design
Conceptualize Game Mechanics: Outline the core mechanics, such as unit movement, combat, and resource management.
Design the Game World: Sketch the battlefield layout, unit types, and possible strategies.
Define Game Rules: Establish how players win, lose, and interact with the game world.

# Step 2: Setting Up the Development Environment
Choose a 3D Engine: For a web-based game, Three.js or Babylon.js are popular choices that work well with HTML5 Canvas.
Setup Project Structure: Initialize your project with necessary libraries and a basic file structure.

# Step 3: Implementing Core Game Features
Rendering the Battlefield: Start by rendering a simple 3D scene representing the battlefield.

# Initialize a 3D renderer using your chosen engine.
Create a basic ground plane and some placeholder objects for units.
Camera Control: Implement an omnipresent camera system.

Allow the camera to pan, zoom, and rotate around the battlefield, giving players a comprehensive view.
Unit Movement and Interaction:

Create simple unit models (or placeholders).
Implement basic movement controls allowing you to command units across the battlefield.
Include simple collision detection to prevent units from overlapping.
Combat System: Develop a basic combat system.

Define how units attack and take damage.
Implement a health system for units.

# Step 4: Advanced Features
AI for Enemy Units: Program AI for enemy units to provide a challenge to the player.
Enhancements and Optimizations: Improve graphics, implement more complex unit behaviors, and optimize performance.
Multiplayer (Optional): If desired, add multiplayer capabilities using WebSockets or a similar technology for real-time gameplay.

# Step 5: Testing and Iteration
Playtest: Continuously test the game to find and fix bugs.
Gather Feedback: Allow others to playtest and provide feedback.
Iterate: Refine game mechanics and visuals based on playtesting and feedback.
